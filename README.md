# N3xtcoder Hackathon SCT-18

Presented by [Setlog](https://www.setlog.com/), [Limbiq](https://www.limbiq.com/) for the [N3xtcoders](https://n3xtcoder.org) 2018 hackathon.

## Challenge 2: Code prototype for Limbiq dashboard
The limbiq platform offers „Supply Chain as a Service“ with best practice services that are data driven and based on market knowledge. Due to individually used and on the platform connected modules, the customers can choose only what they need and eliminate intermediaries which will result in a faster, more accessible supply chain for everyone.

Provided:
- Wireframes, personas, user flows:
  * See presentation
- [dummy data](/dummy_data):
  * `purchaseorders.json`: A list of orders placed by the customer to a supplier.
  * `shipments.json`: The different shipments of the products, their mode of transportation and estimated times.

The provided data is just an example. You may extend, reorganize or augment it in any way you see fit for creating an awesome dashboard!
